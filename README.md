## Content difference
Released:
- Basicly is the released new season Manifest/Build

MU:
- Modding United Manifest/Build. Mostly used Zer0Bytes one. (Need to be has event file)

Event:
- If MU decided has 2 build , that's the second one.
- Event files. Probably before any patch

Shey:
- Operation Throwback Manifest/Build, basicly old Zer0 one.


There is what the difference between build:

### Switching On Main
How, and why recommended

## History
History of R6 Downloader/AIO-Tools:\
First Zer0Bytes made his R6Manifest tool, after some trouble with Cheato (Creater by Throwback)\
He decided to delete and go make another modding server, but he deleted all his stuff from Throwback\
So no Manifest file for Throwback, I decided to update his old R6Manifest, adding new manifest, versions of the Game.\
After like 3-5 Months,still not finished and I wanted to upgrade more and more to this project.\
This was my old Batch Project: [Link for AIO-Batch](https://github.com/SlejmUr/R6-AIOTool-Batch)\
Shey created his own R6Manifest named R6Downloader, but he decided to leave after 2.7 version of his tool.\
I still update his old one based on R6Manifest, you can check there: [Link](https://github.com/SlejmUr/Manifest_Tool_TB)\
But after my friends said "Why aren't you make this old AIO-Batch to C# or some other languages?"\
So I started working on it, firstly it was hard to make something that you haven't learned.\
But now I was happy to moved to C# from Batch.\
Soon I will add more and better stuff in it!

## Modding
[!!!!!!]\
Only 3(?) version of R6:S can't be downloaded!\
Because Steam removed 3(?) manifest and any crack with (15 September 2021) version not worked.\
So this 4 version can't be played!

All versions of Old Siege can be modified in memory.\
(Sidenote: Ubi not liking Modding, etc :/) \
Host your own games at RadminVPN, Hamachi, or other services.\
You cannot play online or on Live servers!\
(And probably you will never able to can!)\
Only you can join is Lan made 'servers'!\
Have Fun!

## R6 Store
Conclusions on Online Stores where Siege is on.\
What is a difference on Uplay, EGS, Steam with Downloading\
Uplay:\
Uplay not has publicly available manifest gathering Database.\
Plus any downloader like DepotDownloader.\
EGS:\
Has public Downloader.\
Not has manifest gathering Database/website.\
Steam:\
Has DepotDownloader.\
And can get manifests from steamdb.info.\
That's all.
